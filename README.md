## Introduction

This project involves developing, deploying, and enhancing a web application using Google Cloud Run. The web application of the deployed Cloud Run service enables users to upload images, which are then stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Upon each upload, the Gemini API is invoked to generate a JSON file containing a title and description for the uploaded image. This JSON file, named to match the uploaded image, is stored in the same bucket.

The application provides a user-friendly interface where images are displayed as clickable links, each linking to the respective image along with its generated metadata (title and description).

Building upon this foundation, the project further explores automated deployment and revision management within the Cloud Run environment. The existing Cloud Run service is integrated with GitHub, enabling continuous deployment. Every time changes are pushed to the GitHub repository, a new revision is automatically deployed in the Revisions section of the existing Cloud Run service. Traffic is set to 100% for the latest deployed revision, ensuring that all users are served the most up-to-date version of the application.

This automation streamlines development and ensures efficient, hands-free updates to the live application.

- Cloud Run instances are stateless, allowing multiple instances to handle requests concurrently without affecting functionality.
- Google Cloud Storage (GCS) stores images, making them globally accessible to any instance, preventing data loss during scaling.
- Deployment is straightforward using `gcloud run deploy` and can be done directly from the source directory.
- Images and metadata stored in Cloud Storage allow users to access uploaded content seamlessly from any instance.
- The app integrates well with Google services like Cloud Storage and Gemini AI for efficient operations.
- Changes pushed to GitHub trigger automatic deployment to Cloud Run, reducing manual steps and enabling continuous delivery.
- All traffic is routed to the most recent revision, ensuring users experience the latest features and updates.
- Older revisions remain inactive but are retained for rollback if needed, maintaining operational safety.
- The application scales automatically based on incoming traffic, ensuring consistent performance regardless of demand.
- Manual traffic controls allow quick reassignment of traffic to previous revisions if rollback is necessary.

# Cons

- Due to Cloud Run‚Äôs stateless nature, user sessions and context might be lost when requests route between different instances.
- Cold starts can cause delays when new instances spin up after idle periods.
- Distributed handling of requests may cause issues with user session continuity.
- High upload frequency or heavy traffic can lead to throttling or delays accessing Cloud Storage, especially for large files.
- Uploading and processing large images may increase response times and latency.
- The solution lacks built-in user authentication; custom security must be implemented.
- Instances are ephemeral, so any data stored locally is lost on scale down, complicating state management.
- Relying on the latest deployed revision means any bugs affect all users immediately.
- If the latest revision fails, users experience downtime until traffic is manually redirected, possibly degrading user experience.

# Problems Encountered and Solutions

- **Issue:** Gunicorn error "worker spawn failed" and Pillow library not recognized.  
  **Solution:** Used `pip freeze` to verify dependency versions and updated `requirements.txt` accordingly, fixing Pillow version.  

- **Issue:** `main.py` bound to fixed port (5000) incompatible with Cloud Run dynamic ports.  
  **Solution:** Modified `main.py` to bind dynamically to the environment‚Äôs assigned port by using:  
  ```python
  app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8080)))
  ```
